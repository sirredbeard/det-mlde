# How Determined Works

With Determined you can:

-   Use state-of-the-art distributed training to train models faster
    without changing model code.
-   Automatically find high-quality models using advanced hyperparameter
    tuning.
-   Get more from your GPUs and reduce cloud GPU costs with preemptible
    instances and smart scheduling.
-   Leverage experiment tracking out-of-the-box to track and reproduce
    your work, tracking code versions, metrics, checkpoints, and
    hyperparameters.
-   Continue using popular deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow,
    Keras, and PyTorch by simply integrating the Determined API with
    your existing model code.

Determined integrates these features into an easy-to-use,
high-performance deep learning environment so you can spend your time
building models instead of managing infrastructure.
